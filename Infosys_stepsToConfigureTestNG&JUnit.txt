1. Junit/TestNG installation:
 
We need not install TestNG or Junit from marketplace since these are preloaded in the eclipse itself.
 
To check if it is loaded or not, please open Eclipse> Windows > Preferences and check if the TestNG is listed or not. I am attaching a image for your reference.
 
Likewise, Maven is also installed in the same eclipse.
 
The instructions on how to create Junit and TestNG is in the attached pdf.
 
Normally we have certain course materials for these installations. I am mentioning below certain course(s), please ask the trainees to take a look in the below courses:
 
Junit: http://ilp02/stream/Course/IVSIS/page/45
TestNG: http://ilp02/stream/Course/IVSSA/page/9
